# Alcolator
### BAC Calculation in Laboratory Environments
## 1. Install the Prerequisites

Install the prerequisites from [here](https://docs.ultralig.ht/docs/installing-prerequisites) (Windows).

## 2. Clone and setup

Clone the application to your computer and create a build folder:

```shell
cd (path)/Alcolator
mkdir build
```

## 3. Build & run the application

Execute the `build.sh` file first, then the `run.sh` file to run the solution.

Here's this week's effort. Solution is effectively feature complete.

The process has barely changed. Take the include folder I sent you on Canvas and extract it into the root directory. (like alcolator/include/).
After that, create a 'build' folder in the root directory if it is not already there, build the solution using 'build.sh' and then you can run it with 'run.sh'. The shell scripts will take care of everything.

Only things missing are the ability to generate reports (not hard to do according to a google search) and the minimise button functionality. 

I have made you a user account with Administrator permissions. Details are below:

```
Username: t.nguyen
Password: tnguyen123
```

As an administrator you can switch between the admin panel and the experimenting panel. Click 'Experimenter' under the 'file' menu to switch to experimenting mode, and 'Administration' to do the reverse inside the experimenting panel. Data manipulation, calculation, searching, sorting, permissions logic, password security, you name it, it's been done :).

Hope you like it!
